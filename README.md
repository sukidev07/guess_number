# guess_number
working project training core concepts of creating a guess the number game

Notes:
how "random" numbers work in almost every programming language.

What you've created is called a pseudo-random number generator.

Pseudo means "not genuinely" or "fake."

Random means... well, random!

The numbers appear random, but as you correctly noticed, they are generated by a predictable mathematical formula. If you give the formula the same starting input (the seed), it will produce the exact same output every single time.

Think of it like shuffling a deck of cards. If you could perform the exact same series of shuffles, cuts, and moves every single time, you would end up with the same card order. Our generate_secret_number function is that perfect shuffler, and the "seed" is the starting order of the deck.

This is actually a very useful feature in science, simulations, and even game development for testing, as it allows for repeatable results.
