# guess_number
Simple game of guess the number within 3 attempts.
The number is randomly genreated and you need to use imput the correct whole number 1-10.
You get the result either by being correct or failing either way you get to know the number you are either correct or not.

Very simple original game to make, with some improved next steps, breaking functions out into modules, etc and practicing a creation using Ai prompts being used as the project teacher.

Base review of creating and improving the number guessing game using Ai to help train the logic flow.
Added my own notes to help and used my own methods to accomplish similar goals against my logic.
Went through stages to validate refactoring the code, breaking it into multiple modules so they can be reused for future use cases.
